Description:

This application utilizes the Yelp API in order to provide food solutions depending on how much you have had to drink.  The more sober you are the higher priced restaurants will be returned.  If you have drank multiple drinks then cheap eats will be returned.  The page requires a login before entering the amount of drinks and your location.

Technologies that were used to create this were Node.js, Handlebars and MySQL.
